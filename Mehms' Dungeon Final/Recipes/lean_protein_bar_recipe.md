## 🥄 Directions

1. **Mix dry ingredients** in a bowl (protein powder, almond flour, flax, psyllium, optional coconut, spices).
2. In a separate bowl, **soften nut butter** (microwave 10–15 sec if needed).
3. Add wet ingredients to dry, mixing by:
   - **Blender** (preferably with dough setting or tamper)
   - **Stand mixer** with paddle attachment
4. Add water 1 tbsp at a time until dough-like consistency is reached.
5. Stir in chocolate chips by hand.
6. Scoop the dough into a silicone or parchment-lined **cupcake tray**, pressing each portion firmly.
7. Chill 30–60 minutes until firm. Each cup = 1 serving (12 total).

## 🍬 Sweetener Notes

## 🍫 Optional Add-Ins
