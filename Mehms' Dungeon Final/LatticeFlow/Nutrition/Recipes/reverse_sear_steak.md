# 🥩 Reverse Sear Steak Guide

Perfectly cook a thick steak edge-to-edge with a crusty sear using the reverse sear method.

---

## 🔪 1. Choose the Right Steak
- **Cut:** Ribeye, striploin, sirloin, or tenderloin
- **Thickness:** Ideal is 1.5–2.5 inches
- **Why:** Thicker steaks benefit more from gentle, even heat

---

## 🧂 2. Season Generously
- Season with kosher salt and cracked black pepper
- Optional: dry-brine uncovered in the fridge 4–24 hours
- **Why:** Improves flavor, juiciness, and browning

---

## 🌡️ 3. Oven Cook Low & Slow
- Preheat oven to **225–275°F (107–135°C)**
- Place steak on a wire rack over a baking sheet
- Cook until internal temp reaches:
  - **115°F** (rare)
  - **120°F** (medium-rare)
  - **130°F** (medium)
- **Why:** Gives edge-to-edge doneness with minimal overshoot

---

## 🧼 4. Rest Briefly
- Rest 5–10 minutes to let juices settle
- Use the time to heat your searing pan

---

## 🍳 5. Sear to Finish
- Use cast iron or steel pan, very hot
- Add a small amount of **avocado or grapeseed oil**
- Sear steak **45–60 sec per side** + edges

---

## 🧈 6. Optional Butter, Garlic & Herb Baste

### When:
- Add after you **flip to sear the second side**

### How:
- Add to pan:
  - **1–2 tbsp butter**
  - **2–3 smashed garlic cloves** (skin on)
  - **1–2 sprigs thyme or rosemary**
- Tilt pan to pool butter
- **Spoon hot butter repeatedly over top of steak** for 30–60 sec

### Why:
- **Butter = rich crust & flavor**
- **Garlic & herbs = aroma and depth**
- **Hot fat = rapid surface browning (Maillard reaction)**

---

## ⏱️ 7. Final Rest (Optional)
- Let steak rest 3–5 minutes
- Slice **against the grain**

---

## ✅ Done!
Enjoy a perfectly cooked, juicy steak with a deeply flavorful crust.
