* For all hiring, detailed job descriptions required and explanations of why AI can't solve that problem with executive team committed to providing the resources necessary to use AI to solve problems

* Should be on top of all of the changes in all AI models to understand how they can each be incorporated into the business

* Remember from Neil, FPA was in the room with Product to help determine what to build based on how it will impact the business --> interactive,  collaborative, and efficient

* My next opportunity should be somewhere that has a clear vision of how AI is going to supercharge growth and expand what products can be offered to customers (Aaron Levie, CEO of Box) 

* Another “Dan-ism,” as Sturm called it, is Hinge’s philosophy around writing. Perez has employees write memos, typically up to six pages long, instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings. Perez was inspired by a similar practice at Amazon, according to current and former employees, and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points. Hinge’s memo culture can be an adjustment, particularly for new employees. Sturm said he thought the practice was “insane” at first, but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches.
