# 🧠 One-Pager: Reactivity Catch & Shift Tool

## Purpose
Quick-access guide to defusing emotional reactivity when receiving feedback.

---

## 🚨 Step 1: Red Flag Noticing
> "This is a reaction, not reality."

**When to use:**  
- Feeling heat, tightness, urgency, impulse to defend or withdraw.

**Optional script:**  
> "My body’s reacting fast right now — I want to hear you better but need a sec."

---

## 🧘 Step 2: Micro-Regulation Pause
> Inhale 4s / Exhale 8s  
> Touch something solid  
> Place hand on chest

**Script:**  
> "I am safe. I’m allowed to feel and still stay connected."

**Optional (to partner):**  
> "I need 20 seconds to calm my body so I can respond with care."

---

## 🔄 Step 3: Reflect + Rephrase (R²)
> "What I’m hearing is… [summary].  
> What I’m feeling is… [emotion].  
> Can I explain why this is hard to process?"

---

## 🧘 Reflection Prompts
- What were my body signals?
- What story did I tell myself?
- Which phrase will I rehearse next time?

---

## 💬 Opening with Wife
> “I’m trying to break an old pattern of shutting down or reacting. I’m working on a new tool. I’d love your patience while I learn to pause and stay open.”

---

## ❤️ Reminders
- Defensiveness = protection, not failure  
- You can validate without surrendering truth  
- You don’t need to be perfect to be loved
