### Next Steps (***WE CAN EDIT FILES IN GITHUB!!!***) 
- Journaling
	- Weekly review workflow
	- ADHD and reactivity materials to be iterated on as it should more fleshed out
	- Ideate and build PM (mimic AM routine as a "reflection" of that day)
	- Made up content for ADHD and Reactivity
	- Tone could be better as it’s definitely adding in stuff that I didn’t outline 
	- Mantra is spelled wrong and it’s not relevant anymore
	- didn’t ask for sleep hours but I may skip that and call it recovery going forward 
	- Didn’t ask for calendar focus and Google keep (rename)
	- Tags aren’t really what I wanted 
	- No prompting for depth 
	- Feels more like a checklist and less like an opportunity for meaningful intention setting
	- Should probably download and try some other apps 
	- Way too many inputs - combine some sections
	- Review tracked metrics (mood, energy, and recover) and see if we can find 2-3 other times in a day where we can log those metrics 
- Automation
	- Logic is now set up for me to manually move files to save on development effort 
	- Workout
		- Build Actions in Workout GPT
	- Journal
		- PM pulls AM record for reflection
		- Pull last weekly review for current weeks intentions and reflections
		- Logic to prompt weekly review workflow
- From there, THEN move onto the actual app so you can start using the most important ones, REASSESS here
### 📓 Journaling Module
- Use You.com to pull cluster research papers 
- Journaling Research Prompt:  
  - Continue current prompt  
  - Ask it to create a follow-up prompt for running this same exercise with other modules and areas of focus  
  - Can we incorporate notes from therapy sessions?  
- Leave room for physical journaling and “upload” as some methods may not play well within the app (Morning Pages)  
- Relationship tracker for intentions  
- Educated LLM in background for education and deeper insight, flesh the idea out  
- Take notes on each one on iPad with pen so we can see how our thought pattern has evolved over time and where we made certain decisions  
- We may also want to go deeper on certain topics and get more insights or build other research paper topics  
- Self-integrated (accumulate your own reports and history) personal holistic health app  
- Then we can upload the research papers, our notes, etc to start reinforcing the brain of what will help us build the end product  
- Privacy will be paramount, can we follow Obsidian’s privacy template to store data on local devices and pull when needed?  
- Update the metrics universe once all research reports have been reviewed
- Provide ability for “reminders” in the morning or perhaps just fold it into the Intention setting section as “remember these items you have on your mind” + true app should perhaps have a way to enter these during weekly or monthly reviews 
- Physical morning actions or routine setting should be included if someone wants to remind themselves of a routine 

### 🥦 Nutrition Module
- Grocery list
- Macro tracking
- Macro cheat sheet 

### 📚 Learning Module
- “Impact value” of team members to drive promotions to reward difference makers  
- Executive manifesto
- How do product teams actually build products?
- Is Motion legit?

### 🏋️ Workout Module
- This is the mental health part and we will eventually build the physical health one (workout, nutrition, medical reports, etc.)  
- Integrating Health and Runna data for coding project
- Hormone replacement therapy 

### ✅ Task Manager Module
- Task manager module to get rid of TickTick  
- How do I more effectively “set my week up” to feel good about what I have to do? Do I have everything present? Do I put dates beside each thing based on when I think I can actually get it done so they pop up on those days when I review? Do I set aside 2-3 hours each day to give myself the breathing room of knowing I have time to do it?
