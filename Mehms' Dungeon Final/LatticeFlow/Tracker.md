### Next Steps
- Review Obsidian sync settings (password may just be our Obsidian password - but I don’t want to pay if I don’t have to)
- Journaling
	- Weekly review workflow
	- PM (mimic AM routine as a "reflection" of that day)
- Automation
	- Push and pull files automatically and perhaps even pull files so that we can easily edit them without ChatGPT's help
	- Logic to read files (workouts = last log's weights/RPE, etc. and journaling = PM pulls AM)
	- Ideate on other automations directly to Obsidian
- From there, THEN move onto the actual app so you can start using the most important ones, REASSESS here
### 📓 Journaling Module
- Use You.com to pull cluster research papers 
- Journaling Research Prompt:  
  - Continue current prompt  
  - Ask it to create a follow-up prompt for running this same exercise with other modules and areas of focus  
  - Can we incorporate notes from therapy sessions?  
- Leave room for physical journaling and “upload” as some methods may not play well within the app (Morning Pages)  
- Relationship tracker for intentions  
- Educated LLM in background for education and deeper insight, flesh the idea out  
- Take notes on each one on iPad with pen so we can see how our thought pattern has evolved over time and where we made certain decisions  
- We may also want to go deeper on certain topics and get more insights or build other research paper topics  
- Self-integrated (accumulate your own reports and history) personal holistic health app  
- Then we can upload the research papers, our notes, etc to start reinforcing the brain of what will help us build the end product  
- Privacy will be paramount, can we follow Obsidian’s privacy template to store data on local devices and pull when needed?  
- Update the metrics universe once all research reports have been reviewed
- Provide ability for “reminders” in the morning or perhaps just fold it into the Intention setting section as “remember these items you have on your mind” + true app should perhaps have a way to enter these during weekly or monthly reviews 
- Physical morning actions or routine setting should be included if someone wants to remind themselves of a routine

### ✅ Task Manager Module
- Task manager module to get rid of TickTick  
- How do I more effectively “set my week up” to feel good about what I have to do? Do I have everything present? Do I put dates beside each thing based on when I think I can actually get it done so they pop up on those days when I review? Do I set aside 2-3 hours each day to give myself the breathing room of knowing I have time to do it?
