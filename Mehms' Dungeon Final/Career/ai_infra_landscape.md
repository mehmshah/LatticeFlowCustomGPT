# AI Infrastructure Landscape: A Strategic Deep Dive

## I. Executive Summary

Artificial intelligence infrastructure encompasses the full stack of tools, hardware, platforms, and services that enable the training, deployment, and scaling of AI models. From raw data pipelines to billion-parameter foundation models and consumer-facing apps, the AI ecosystem is modular, rapidly evolving, and highly interdependent.

This paper breaks the ecosystem into eight critical layers, identifies major players and their interdependencies, and proposes a robust playbook for evaluating AI vendors and claims. We explore where margins are concentrated, where defensibility lies, and how to detect real versus superficial AI capabilities.

## III. Ecosystem Interactions & Value Chains

- **Workflow:**
  - Data ingestion → cleaning/labeling → model training (or API use) → embedding → RAG → inference → app layer
- **Value Concentration:**
  - Compute (NVIDIA), APIs (OpenAI), infra reselling (AWS/Azure), app UX (Perplexity, Notion)
- **Strategic Behaviors:**
  - Open-source to gain mindshare → monetization via hosting (e.g., HuggingFace)
  - Closed-source moat + vertical integration (OpenAI → Azure)
  - GPU-rich startups reselling inference (CoreWeave, Together)

## IV. Evaluation Playbook: Spotting Real AI

### A. Heuristics
- Do they train models or wrap existing APIs?
- Can they explain their prompt strategies, model architecture, or fine-tuning method?
- Do they use agents, embeddings, retrieval, or just surface-level AI claims?
- Is latency acceptable for real-time use? (Check inference stack)
- Do they offer full-stack observability (e.g. token usage, prompt replay, tracing)?

### B. Patterns to Recognize
| Pattern            | Real AI? | Notes |
|--------------------|----------|-------|
| API wrapper        | ❌       | May offer value, but low defensibility unless UX/verticalized |
| Fine-tuned model   | ✅       | Requires data, training infra, tuning methods |
| Proprietary model  | ✅✅     | Highest defensibility, usually infra-intensive |
| Embedded LLM agent | ✅       | Increasingly common in RAG + tool use workflows |
| "AI Copilot" claim | ⚠️       | Check for decision logic vs prompt template |

### C. Key Questions to Ask Vendors
- What model(s) are you using? Are they proprietary or via API?
- How is the model hosted? (Cloud, edge, hybrid?)
- Do you fine-tune or just prompt-engineer?
- How do you handle data privacy and leakage?
- What observability and debugging tools are available?
- How do you measure model accuracy, hallucinations, or drift?
