# üìö Personal Knowledge & Learning System ‚Äì v1.1

## üéØ Purpose
To design a dynamic, sustainable, and AI-augmented learning system that helps Mehms:
- Absorb relevant content across multiple domains (career-first, life-expanding)
- Capture, organize, and synthesize insights
- Support strategic thinking, pattern recognition, and future-oriented creativity
- Evolve continuously without becoming bloated or overwhelming

## üß† System Architecture

### üîÄ Two-Zone Vault Structure

#### 1. üì• Ingestion Sources (Inputs)
Content you intentionally follow or track

- `Books to Ingest.md`
- `Podcasts to Track.md`
- `Newsletters to Follow.md`
- `People of Interest/` (e.g., Vitaly, Yaser, exec profiles)
- `Networks & Accelerators.md` (e.g., MaRS, YC, Georgian, F-Suite)
- `Content Streams.md` (e.g., LinkedIn follows, economic report feeds, GPT tools)

#### 2. üìò Learning & Insights (Outputs)
Content after reflection, synthesis, and categorization

- `Active Topics/` ‚Äì Key learning domains (e.g., Agentic AI, Leadership Models)
- `Learning Logs/` ‚Äì Weekly & monthly synthesis using prompts
- `Insights & Evergreen Notes/` ‚Äì Atomic ideas, models, references
- `Ideas & Opportunities/` ‚Äì Startup theses, frameworks, hypotheses
- `System Health/` ‚Äì Meta-notes on vault usefulness, bloat review, LLM expansion

### üîÅ Minimal Viable Learning Loop (MVL)

| Step     | Tool(s)               | Cadence   | Action                                      |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ingest   | Snipd, Voice Dream Reader | Daily     | Listen during walks, workouts, or downtime |
| Capture  | Snipd highlights      | Daily     | Tag in the moment or push to inbox          |
| Export   | Obsidian (Learning Vault) | 2x/week  | Auto-send or manually clip to vault         |
| Reflect  | GPT Prompts + Learning Log | Weekly | Extract patterns, raise questions           |
| Apply    | GPT, TickTick, Notes  | Weekly/Monthly | Turn insights into actions, decisions, shares |

### üîÅ Review & Reflection Layers

#### üîπ Weekly (10‚Äì15 min)
- What did I learn this week that surprised me?
- What‚Äôs sticking? What‚Äôs drifting?
- What‚Äôs worth exploring deeper next week?
- Add 3‚Äì5 key insights to `Learning Log`

#### üîπ Monthly (30 min)
- What patterns are showing up?
- What content had the highest ROI?
- Any blindspots I‚Äôm noticing?
- Clean up unused sources or workflows

#### üîπ Quarterly (45‚Äì60 min)
- **System Health Review**:
  - Is this system too bloated?
  - Am I acting on what I learn?
  - What components are unused or burdensome?
  - What‚Äôs worth pruning, automating, or pausing?
- **Life Alignment**:

## üìà Goals Over Time

- High-leverage repository of wisdom
- LLM-based idea generation
- Career-first lens, life-expanding
- Company-wide learning frameworks
- Investments, startup ideas, GPT tools

## üîé Key Design Principles

- üß† Curated > Volume
- ü™∂ Light touch > Overbuilding
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Evolving system > Static library
- ‚è≥ Low time load (~3 hrs/week incl. review)
- ü§ñ AI-first tagging & synthesis
- üéØ Anchored in reflection and action

## üß† Learning Prompts (Weekly Logs)

- What‚Äôs one idea I could use this week?
- Did anything challenge my beliefs?
- What topic am I curious about now?
