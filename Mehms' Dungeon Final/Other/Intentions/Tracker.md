### Next Steps
- Speak to Mike Hollinger about agreements (5-10% equity over 3 years, 5-10 hours a month, milestones to be agreed upon
- Review and finalize long range plan with team in person
- Set up and learn Linear
- Review Figma
- Research AI unit economics (tech stack needed)
- Launch strategy for GTM (we want to launch broadly in 3 months and want to have everything ironed out for that launch)
- Manifesto of values and principles
- Savings analysis on purchases
- Beta user slack channel
- Beta user 12 month free with monthly survey 
- NLP upload of bills (utility and internet), invoices (pet expenses), receipts (groceries) and store as written data + some kind of feedback loop that ties into goals
- Subscription tiers (no AI vs AI) and monthly vs annual plans
- How do we measure users value derived? Perhaps we score them monthly to see how the app has improved their happiness, fulfillment and relationship with their money
- Standardize some of the tags or create one that shows whether a purchase was positive or negative or fulfilling / must have vs nice to have in order to distinguish between discretionary expenses that affect happiness etc
