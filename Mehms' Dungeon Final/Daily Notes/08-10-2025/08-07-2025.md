üó£Ô∏è Journaling - I'm not gonna be doing my full routine thing for journalling because it's my birthday and I don't want to but I am just gonna quickly note that I'm grateful to Gabby for planning me such a fun unique birthday party last night or I got to work out with my friends which at first I was kinda like but then when we were doing I was like this is actually really fun to see everybody like sprinting like all these people different people in my lives in my life who are like doing something that I enjoyed doing so I really was appreciative and I slept in this morning which is nice and yeah just felt really good and I'm very happy I'm very grateful to her for thinking of such a cool thing for me
