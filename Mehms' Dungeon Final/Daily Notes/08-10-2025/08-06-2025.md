🗣️ Journaling - I think I really got myself worked up today between smoking a joint in the morning and getting too involved in these recruiter conversations and feeling anxious about tonight because I know Gabby's plan something it's probably at Diandra's but yeah not sure so feel like I need a time out and I think a shower and cold shower will be really good to just like shock my body a little bit wake up
