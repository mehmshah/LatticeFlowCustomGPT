I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I feel so caught in between

I don't know anymore I feel super lost and I feel like I am caught in between who I grew up as and what I am trying to fix around this like people pleasing narrative that compels me to feel so upset when people aren't pleased with me and where there is feedback and criticism and I don't even know if it's like shame or guilt anymore like I just I'm so tired of it because it's not protecting me anymore it's just like isolating me even more like that's why I don't wanna talk to my friends I'm afraid of what they might say that's why I don't wanna like I guess I don't wanna spend time with people cause I'm afraid of what they might say and I don't wanna be afraid anymore I don't wanna be afraid

Why do I inherently believe that everyone has a problem with me that I'm not kind and I'm not thinking about others not pleasing them state of mind is so influential to me is it because my parents never helped me understand that our problems at home or not about me that there's nothing that I could've done about it I was OK anyways I struggling so hard

Kathy telling me that the cactus is not a priority which triggered me and I use my reactivity routine to calm down starting to note these for future consideration

What bothered me about today and her feedback was her tone and now she sounded so condescending I like it just not a priority she doesn't the situation

I shared with Gabby that reactivity script so hopefully going forward when I'm defensive she sees them defensive I can take a break conscious break and take a step aside

Mood is a 67 feel kinda anxious of smoking a joint energy is 6 to 7 because I feel like chilling and recovery is three or four because my body hurts from running and I feel tired

Mood is 6.5
Energy is a 5
Recovery is. 5.5

Impulsivity putting a damper on the day

I think I really got myself worked up today between smoking a joint in the morning and getting too involved in these recruiter conversations and feeling anxious about tonight because I know Gabby's plan something it's probably at Diandra's but yeah not sure so feel like I need a time out and I think a shower and cold shower will be really good to just like shock my body a little bit wake up

Why do I insist on having these like daydreams or something bad happening I guess that people will feel bad for me? I don't know why I can cock these negative scenarios and I do it obsessively sometimes

I'm not gonna be doing my full routine thing for journalling because it's my birthday and I don't want to but I am just gonna quickly note that I'm grateful to Gabby for planning me such a fun unique birthday party last night or I got to work out with my friends which at first I was kinda like but then when we were doing I was like this is actually really fun to see everybody like sprinting like all these people different people in my lives in my life who are like doing something that I enjoyed doing so I really was appreciative and I slept in this morning which is nice and yeah just felt really good and I'm very happy I'm very grateful to her for thinking of such a cool thing for me

I did more work on lattice flow than I planned I did two extra Pomodoro's but I didn't really follow the Pomodoro technique and I didn't take any time for myself today prior to Cleo being done with Jessica so I feel like I was pretty regulated because of my conversation with Gabby and just defaulted to getting some stuff done and worked on some other tasks as well but tomorrow morning Gabby's away with Cleo and will bring her back for a nap so I will work out after seeing Elie and then while she's napping I will prep lunch and just fucking chill
